 *   - If the query has not been loaded yet (queryReference==null), it displays a button for the user to load the query
 *   - Af the query has been loaded already (queryReference==null), it displays:
 *      - A button for the user to dispose the query and start over again, and 
 *      - A DataDisplay component that will display the result of the query by providing to it the query object itself ples the instance of the loaded query results
 * 
 * Important: In order to display a fragment further down in a component, the query includes the name of the fragment with the spread `...`operator like:
